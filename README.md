# IT-DOS
Iterkocze IT-DOS Kernel.

A casual and hobbyist attempt to create an operating system Kernel. There are no long-term or short-term plans for it. <br> <br>
DOS part in name is only a stylistic part and does not imply any association with MS-DOS or reflect its functionality. <br>

# Building
To build IT-DOS you need:
- xorriso
- grub

IT-DOS also requires the GCC cross-compiler. If you don't have it, see how to compile it here: https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler

After compiling the GCC cross-compiler, change the path to it in the makefile. Then run it.
